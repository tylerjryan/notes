* [API Reference on Selections](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections)

## A Subclass of array

* selections are NOT arrays of DOM elements
* selections are a *subclass* of array. This subclass provides methods to manipulate selected elements, such as setting attributes and styles. It also inherits native array methods such as `forEach` and `map`, but you often won't use these as D3 provides convenient alternatives such as `selection.each`. A few natives are even overriden to adapt their behavior to selections

## Grouping elements

* Selections are *array of arrays* of elements
* A selection is an array of groups, and each group is an array of elements.
* groups are plain arrays
* `d3.select` returns a selection with one group containing the selected element
* `d3.selectAll` returns a selection with one group containing any number of elements
* `selection.selectAll` can return a selection with multiple groups
  * for example, you select all table rows and then select the rows' cells:
  * `d3.selectAll("tr").selectAll("td")`
* with `selectAll`, **every element in the old selection becomes a group in the new selection**
* each group has a `parentNode` property which stores the share parent of all the group's elements
  * for selections returned by `d3.select/selectAll`, the parent element is the *document element*
* when using a function to define a `selection.attr` or `selection.style`, the function is called for each element
  * the main difference with grouping is that the second argument to your function (i) is the *within-group* index rather than the *within-selection* index

## Non-Grouping Operations

* `select` preserves grouping but `selectAll` does not. This means that `select` propagates data from parent to child, but `selectAll` does not (hence the need for a data-join)
* `append` and `insert` methods are wrappers on top of `select`, so they preserve grouping and propagate data

## Null Elements

* Groups can contain nulls to indicate missing elements
* nulls are ignored for most operations; so D3 will skip them when applying styles and attributes
* null elements can occur when `selection.select` cannot find a matching element for a given selector; the method must preserve the grouping structure, so it fills in missing slots with null.

## Bound to Data

* data is NOT a property of the selection, but a property of its elements.
* when you bind data to a selection, the data is stored in the DOM rather than in the selection in the `__data__` property of each element; if an element lacks this property, the associated datum is undefined
* data is persistent while selections are transient; you can reselect elements from the DOM and they will retain whatever data was previously bound to them
* data binding can be done 3 ways:
  * joined to groups of elements via `selection.data`
  * assigned to individual elements via `selection.datum`
  * inherited from a parent via `append`, `insert`, or `select`
* you don't need to set the `__data__` property directly because you can use `selection.datum`
> document.body.__data__ = 42 SAME AS  d3.select("body").datum(42)

## What is Data?

* Data in D3 can be any array of values. Values can be an objects
* `selection.data` can accept either a constant value or a function to define a value per-element (ie. `function(d) {return d.color}`)
* **unlike other selection methods**, `selection.data` defined data per-group rather than per-element: data is expressed as an array of values for the group, or a function that returns such an array
  * therefore, a grouped selection must have correspondingly grouped data
  * data is typically expressed as a function of parent data, facilitating the creation of hierarchical DOM elements from hierarchical data
  * your data function is passed the datum of the group's `parentNode` (d) and the group's index (i)
  * for selections with a single group, you can simply pass the array to `selection.data` directly; you only need a function when binding different data to different groups

## The Key to Enlightenment

* to join data to elements, we must know which datum should be assigned to which element
* this is done using **pairing keys**
  * a key is an identifying string, such as a name
  * when the key for a datum and an element are equal the datum is assigned to that element
* the simplest method of assigning keys is by index: the first datum and the first element have the key "0", then next pair has key "1", and so on; this works well when the order of the data and elements are the same.
* when order differs, you can specify a key function as the second argument to `selection.data`. This function should take the datum or element and return the key
* each group is joined independently, so keys only need to be unique within a group, not across the entire selection
* The key function is called for each old element and each new data: ten times in this example. The previously-bound data is used to compute old keys, while the new data is used to compute new keys.

## Enter, Update, and Exit

* the key functions discussed in the previous section seem to assume an exact 1:1 match between data and elements. But what happens when there’s no matching element for a given datum, or no matching datum for a given element?
* When joining elements to data by key, there are three possible logical outcomes:
  * Update - There was a matching element for a given datum.
    * if you call `selection.data`, where selection already contains data, and then pass in new data, this will return a selection containing only the elements that are present in both the old and new data based on the key function.
* Enter
  * Enter - There was no matching element for a given datum.
    * if you call `selection.enter` on the selection that was returned from `selection.data`, this will return all elements that are present in the new data but NOT in the old data
    * While update and exit are normal selections, enter is a subclass of selection. This is necessary because it represents elements that do not yet exist. An enter selection contains placeholders rather than DOM elements; these placeholders are simply objects with a __data__ property
    * The implementation of enter.select is then specialized such that nodes are inserted into the group’s parent, replacing the placeholder.
    * The placeholders in an enter selection are typically transient; the enter selection is replaced with a normal selection of elements when you call `enter.append` or `enter.insert`.
    * This is why it is critical to call selection.selectAll prior to a data join: it establishes the parent node for entering elements.
    * To reduce duplicate code, `enter.append` has a convenient side-effect: it replaces null elements in the update selection with the newly-created elements from the enter selection. Thus, after `enter.append`, the update selection is modified to contain both entering and updating elements.  
  * Exit - There was no matching datum for a given element.
    * if you call `selection.exit` on the selection that was returned from `selection.data`, this will return all elements that are present in the old data but NOT in the new data
* These are the three selections returned by `selection.data`, `selection.enter` and `selection.exit`, respectively
* here is a good [general update pattern](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808218) for reference
